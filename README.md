# Datadog

The datadog agent can be setup to collect logs and metrics from a host machine, from running docker containers or from a kubernetes cluster. In the following section, I outline how to setup the agent to collect logs from a host machine by tailing a file or by monitoring running docker containers.

## Agent setup

See [agent setup](./docs/agent-setup.md) for documentation on setting up the Datadog agent via a number of options.

## Agent requests and payloads

See [agent requests](./docs/agent-requests.md) for documentation on the requests the agent makes along with samples of the request payload.

## Agent event types

The Datadog agent collects events falling into various categories. For pipeline use case, we care about logs, metrics and traces (Datadog calls them APM).

### Definitions

Logs: detailed event records generated by applications, services, etc.
Metrics: numerical timeseries data respresenting things like system health, etc. See [metrics](./docs/metrics.md) documentation for additional information on metrics.
Traces (APM): traces the path of requests through applications. See [use cases](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/#use-cases).

## Datadog billing

See [billing](./docs/billing.md) for documentation on billing.
